# Implement a function returning n most popular Github
# repositories belonging to a specific user.
#
# Github has a public API you can use.
#
# Assume popularity is measured by:
#   forks_count + stargazers_count + watchers_count
#
# - Use whatever resources / documentation you need.
# - Adding additional dependencies is allowed.
# - Don't forget to add unit tests.
